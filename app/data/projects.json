During my time at Wireworks I led many projects in partnership with top advertising agencies and also direct to a wide range of clients from Pepsico to Reckitt Benckiser. I was responsible for the entire creative output of the studio - this meant directing and managing teams of designers and developers across numerous projects simultaneously. Being a startup company has meant I was also still very much involved in the production process and so have more than kept my hand in - designing, animating and coding on a daily basis.</p>",
